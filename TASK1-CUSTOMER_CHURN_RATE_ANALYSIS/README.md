# Customer Churn Analysis
Hello... I have managed this project as a way to display my skills to potential employers. If you have found yourself here it is likely because I applied for a position at your place of employment. Thank you for taking the time to visit!

I chose this dataset because customer retention is something I know nothing about it. I thought it would be a nice challenge to first time look into the telecommunications world for my first project. I originally conducted this experiment in R for a potential employer a few years ago. The data was taken from the **Telco Customer Churn** dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).

The project is a classification problem with implementations of Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine. I focus on the recall score as customer retention is the goal of the project. After evaluation of the results, I implement **Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)** to increase the model's performance and attain better recall scores.
